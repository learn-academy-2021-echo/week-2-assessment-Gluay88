# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameter is a name of variable we pass it into a function (it's more like a placeholder for an argument) but an argument is the real value we pass it into the function (input and actual value).

  Researched answer: A parameter is a named variable passed into a function. Parameter variables are used to import arguments into functions. An argument is a value (primitive or object) passed as input to a function.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are  they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: Value, index, and array. Value is required (the first position in the parameter) but the other: index and array are optional.

  Researched answer: Value, index, and array. value: it's required parameter and it holds the value of current element.
  index: it's optional parameter and it holds the index of current element.
  array: it's optional parameter and it holds the array.



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: It'a a way of accessing variables that allows us to take an object or array then can unpack the values into individual variables.

  Researched answer: The object destructuring is a feature that came along with ES6. Destructuring is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables. That is, we can extract data from arrays and objects and assign them to variables.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is a block of code performing some specific set of tasks. It's executed when something calls or invokes it and lives on its own. A method is property of an object. It can be called by the name of its object and its method name using dot notation or square bracket notation.

  Researched answer: Functions are reusable pieces of code that only execute when invoked and always return an output. Functions can have information (arguments) passed into the scope of the function through placeholders called parameters.
  Methods can be used to create a variable accessing the value within the object.
  When a function belongs to an object it is called a method.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is a blueprint/template for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class.

  Researched answer: Class is used as a template for declaring and
  creating the objects. Object is the cross section of data (static information) and behavior (methods) and is an instance of a class.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Some declarations and returns of functions have be called first on top of the page: like var and const. It doesn't matter where we call or put it in a program. (I still don't quite understanding it.)

  Researched answer: Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code. Hoisting allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance:
A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class

2. React:
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

3. React state:
React components has a built-in state object.
The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.
When the state object changes, the component re-renders.

4. React lifecycle methods:
Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.
The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

5. DOM:
The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.
