# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameter is a name of variable we pass it into a function (it's more like a placeholder for an argument) but an argument is the real value we pass it into the function (input and actual value).

  Researched answer: A parameter is a named variable passed into a function. Parameter variables are used to import arguments into functions. An argument is a value (primitive or object) passed as input to a function.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: Value, index, and array. Value is required (the first position in the parameter) but the other: index and array are optional.

  Researched answer: Value, index, and array. value: it's required parameter and it holds the value of current element.
index: it's optional parameter and it holds the index of current element.
array: it's optional parameter and it holds the array.



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: It'a a way of accessing variables that allows us to take an object or array then can unpack the values into individual variables.

  Researched answer: The object destructuring is a feature that came along with ES6. Destructuring is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables. That is, we can extract data from arrays and objects and assign them to variables.
